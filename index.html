            <h1 class="title">Rethinking Urban Life in a Post-Commute Canada</h1>

                As remote work settles into the cultural mainstream, Canadian cities are being
                forced to confront an uncomfortable question: what is a downtown core without
                the daily rush of commuters? For decades, our urban planning philosophies
                have revolved around the assumption that workers must travel to a central hub.

            <p>
                But now, as more companies embrace distributed work models, the incentives
                that once shaped our skylines are shifting. Office towers—long symbols of
                productivity—sit half-empty during peak hours, and cafés built for
                business crowds face disappearing foot traffic.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                “This is a generational moment,” says one urban policy expert. “We can either
                wait for a return to the past, or we can design cities for the lives Canadians
                actually live today.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Some municipalities are exploring bold adaptive strategies: converting unused
                commercial floors into residential units, expanding green spaces, and redesigning
                transit systems for flexibility rather than funneling. Whether these plans will
                succeed depends on political will—and whether citizens can imagine a new social
                contract with their cities.
