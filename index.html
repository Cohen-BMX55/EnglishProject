        <p>
            Over the past two decades, digital media has reshaped the landscape of information in ways
            few could have predicted. What was once a top-down model—news delivered from institutions
            to audiences—has become a sprawling network of voices, platforms, and competing narratives.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to media theorists, this shift has created unprecedented opportunities for
            participation while also opening the door to misinformation and fragmented realities.
            “People are more connected than ever,” one analyst notes, “but they are rarely connected 
            to the same facts.”
        </p>

        <h2>The Rise of Algorithmic News</h2>

        <p>
            Social platforms have become the primary news source for millions, but the content users
            see is heavily shaped by algorithms designed to maximize engagement. This feedback loop
            often reinforces existing beliefs and contributes to ideological bubbles. 
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Algorithms don’t just show us the world — they show us the world they think we want.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            As a result, the lines between reporting, commentary, and entertainment continue to blur,
            raising pressing questions about objectivity, authority, and truth.
        </p>

        <h2>A New Public Literacy</h2>

        <p>
            Media researchers say the crisis isn’t just about misinformation but about a lack of
            “media literacy”—the skills needed to analyze, contextualize, and challenge information.
            Without these tools, audiences can easily be misled by sensationalism, selective framing,
            or outright fabrication.
        </p>

        <p>
            Yet, there is hope. Schools, nonprofits, and independent journalists are increasingly
            pushing for reforms that emphasize critical thinking and source evaluation.
        </p>

        <h2>Where We Go From Here</h2>

        <p>
            As digital platforms continue to evolve, experts argue that the future of public discourse
            will depend on creating spaces where accuracy and nuance are valued. The challenge is not
            small—but neither is the potential for a more informed and connected society.
