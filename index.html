    <!-- ARTICLE BODY -->
    <article class="article-body">
        <p>
            Over the past two decades, digital media has reshaped the landscape of information in ways
            few could have predicted. What was once a top-down model—news delivered from institutions
            to audiences—has become a sprawling network of voices, platforms, and competing narratives.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to media theorists, this shift has created unprecedented opportunities for
            participation while also opening the door to misinformation and fragmented realities.
        </p>

        <h2>The Rise of Algorithmic News</h2>

        <p>
            Social platforms have become the primary news source for millions, but the content users
            see is shaped by algorithms designed to maximize engagement.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “Algorithms don’t just show us the world — they show us the world they think we want.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            As a result, the lines between reporting, commentary, and entertainment continue to blur.
        </p>

        <h2>A New Public Literacy</h2>

        <p>
            Media researchers say the crisis isn’t just about misinformation but about a lack of
            “media literacy”—the skills needed to analyze and challenge information.
        </p>

        <h2>Where We Go From Here</h2>

        <p>
            As digital platforms continue to evolve, experts argue that the future of public discourse
            will depend on creating spaces where accuracy and nuance are valued.
